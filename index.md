## Step 1: Add an image
The normal market down does not support size and alignment:
![alt text for the graph](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)

Should use html tags!
<p align = "center">
  <img width="300" height="300" src="https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png">
</p>


## Step 2: Add code snipet
```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```

What about other codes?

```
p <- ggplot(data, aes(x = width, y = height, color = group)) + geom_point()
```
